Two way conditional check
Two possible outcomes, out of which one will be the answer
Logical Operators (&&, ||)
Positive or Negative
Even or Odd
Profit or Loss

No
+ve or -ve --> -10, 10, 0
p/l --> cp = 100, sp = 90 --> Loss
cp = 90, sp = 100 --> Profit
cp = 100, sp = 100 --> No loss no gain

Multiway conditional check
more than two possible outcomes
else if() statement:

1. else if should always has a previous if
2. else if takes a condition, just like if
3. when condition in if is evaluated to false, the flow comes to else if statement
4. an if statement can have more than one else if statement, but only else statement
5. it is possible to not write an else for an if statement ever after writing some else if statements
