Order of Evaluation of Expressions (Arithmetic Expression)
Add 2 and 2 divide with 2
2 + 2 / 2 --> 2
2 + 2 / 2 --> 3

Operator Precedence
Precedence in Arithmetic Operators in C
+, -, *, /, % --> Arithmetic Operators

*, /, % --> 1st priority
+, - --> 2nd priority
2 + 2 / 2 --> 3 (not 2) because of operator precedence
2 + 1 --> 3


Associativity:
When the operators in an expresson are having same precedence, associativity will be applied.
Two types of associativity
Left to right (Left binding) --> Arithmetic Operators
Right to left (Right binding)

4 * 7 % 5 * 6 / 2
9

(2 + 2) / 2 --> 2



Find out the perimeter of a rectangle
2 * l + b --> Wrong due to precendence
2 * (l + b) --> Right one


Sum of first  n natural numbers
5
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 --> 15
Wrong --> n * n + 1 / 2
Right --> n * (n + 1) / 2


math.h

math.h contains some standard mathematical functions like, pow(), sqrt(), abs(), ceil(), floor(), which will be helpful in calculations.

pow()
pow(a, b) --> a power b

sqrt()
sqrt(x) --> returns square root of x

ceil() --> Round up the given floating point value to it's nearest integer
ceil(x) --> Returns the rounded (round up) x
3.5 --> 4
3.1 --> 4
3.9 --> 4

floor() --> Rounds down the given floating point value to it's nearest integer
3.5 --> 3
3.9 --> 3
3.1 --> 3

abs(x) --> Absolute of x
abs(10) --> 10
abs(-10) --> 10
