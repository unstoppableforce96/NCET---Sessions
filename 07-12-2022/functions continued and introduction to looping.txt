Functions with parameters with return type
void add(int a, int b) // function without return type
{
	printf("%d", a + b);
}


int ADD(int a, int b) // function with return type
{
	return a + b;
}

void pavan(int a, int b) // 10 20
{
	printf("%d", a + b); // 30
}



int PAVAN(int a, int b)
{
	return a + b;
}


For a function that is having a return type, we have to make  the function call in any of the following three ways
1. Make the function call directly in printf() statement
2. Assign the function call to a variable of similar type
3. We can directly insert the function call in a condition







Repetition (Looping)
Looping --> Doing something again and again based on a condition to get something done.
Print the numbers from 1 to 10
1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8		9		10
  +1    +1   +1    +1   +1    +1   +1    +1   +1


while
syntax:
while (condition)
{
	// do some stuff
}


while eating --> as long as eating
while walking --> as long as we are walking
while running
while watching



Looping contains three parts
1. Initialization
2. Condition
3. Updation


syntax of for loop:
for (initialization; condition; updation)
{
	// body
}
