Identifiers
Names we give to variables, functions, structures, arrays are called as 
identifiers.
Rules to create identifier names:
1. Identifier name can be alphanumeric, but it should not start with a digit.
number1 --> valid
1stnumber --> invalid
2. No other special character is allowed, except underscore (_).
number@1 --> invalid
number_1 --> valid
3. Identifier name can start with an underscore(_)
_number --> Vaild
4. You cannot have any white spaces within identifier names.
first name --> invalid
firstName --> valid
first_name --> valid
5. You cannot use a keyword as an identifier.
Keywords are reserved words
int, float, char, double, if, else, for, while
6. Identifier names are case sensitive.
Name
name
NAME, these 3 will be treated as different variables due to case differences.

scanf() --> input function
format specifier
int --> %d
float --> %f
char --> %c
Syntax:
int num; // int --> 4 bytes 1000
scanf("%d", &num); // & --> ampersand


printf() --> output function


Operators:
1. Unary --> single operand
2. Binary --> two operands

Binary Operators
10 + 20
Operand(s): The ones on which the opration is being performed 10 20
Operator: The one which is performing the opeation +

1. Arithmetic
+, -, * (asterisk), /, %
+ --> Add --> sum
- --> Subtract --> diff
* --> Mul --> pro
/ --> div --> quo
% --> div --> remainder
2. Relational
3. Logical (except not)
4. Assignment
5. Bitwise (complement)
